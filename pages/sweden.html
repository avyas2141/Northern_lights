			<div class="column">
				<p> After a long wait, Sweden’s highly anticipated Arctic Bath Hotel and Spa—a floating architectural wonder—is finally set to open in January, 2020. Set in a remote 
					part of northern Sweden, the property promises to be the ultimate place to catch the northern lights. Depending on the time of year, the six overwater cabins
					float on the Lule River or are frozen into it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<p>	There are also six cabins on land. All of the rooms have luxuries like wood-burning stoves and skylights for optimal viewing. 
					Take northern lights photography lessons with an expert, explore the surrounding untouched wilderness or just relax in the spa, which is built around a
					plunge pool that is open to the aurora borealis-streaked skies.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<p>Situated under the northern lights in winter, and the midnight sun during the summer months, Arctic Bath is a unique hotel and spa experience that welcomes 
				guests to immerse themselves in the elements while leaving a minimal environmental footprint behind.</p>
