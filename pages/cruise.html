					<p> An Alaska cruise with Cunard on the Queen Elizabeth is one of the best ways to see the Northern Lights, especially in August or September.
					Alaska is in the Aurora ovalâ€”which is where the lights are most frequently seen. A clear night at sea is the perfect venue to stargaze, and being out on
					the water further illuminates the northern lights, as there is no ambient light interference from land.</p>

				<div class="column">			
					<p>Experts from the National Park Service are onboard to provide commentary, offering guests insight on what they are viewing. And another perk: Cunard is
					celebrating its 180th Anniversary with special sales available on many voyages between July 2020 and May 2022, including Alaska. During other times of the year,
					Cunard also offers special Northern Lights cruises in Norway.</p>
