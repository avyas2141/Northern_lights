                        <p>An Alaska cruise with Cunard on the Queen Elizabeth is one of the best ways to see the Northern Lights, especially in August or September. Alaska is 
						in the Aurora oval—which is where the lights are most frequently seen.</p>
                        <p> A clear night at sea is the perfect venue to stargaze, and being out on the water further illuminates the northern lights, as there  is no ambient
						light interference from land. Experts from the National Park Service are onboard to provide commentary, offering guests insight on what they are viewing.
						And another perk: Cunard is celebrating its 180th Anniversary with special sales available on many voyages between July 2020 and May 2022, 
						including Alaska.</p>

						a remote part of northern Sweden, the property promises to be the ultimate place to catch the northern lights.</p>
                        <p> Depending on the time of year, the six overwater cabins float on the Lule River or are frozen into it. There are also six cabins on land. All of the 
						rooms have luxuries like wood-burning stoves and skylights for optimal viewing. Take northern lights  photography lessons with an expert, explore
						the surrounding untouched wilderness or just relax in the spa, which is built around a plunge pool that is open to the aurora borealis-streaked skies.</p>

						<p>This one’s just for the ladies. Natural Habitat Adventures, a leader in responsible wildlife tourism, is introducing its very first Arctic expedition 
						exclusively for women: the seven-day “Northern Lights and Arctic Cultures.” Inspired by the Arctic’s intrepid female explorers, this epic
						journey was designed by expedition leader Annie Van Dinther.</p>
						<p>"We wanted to create a space for women who are ready for the next big adventure of their lives, where they can feel empowered to be themselves in one
						of the wildest places on the planet," said Van Dinther. Days are spent snowshoeing, igloo-building and dog sledding, while evenings will be spent in 
						search of the northern lights. Expect viewings from a glass Aurora Pod, inside heated domes with 360-degree views, from an isolated cabin deep in the
						boreal forest and in a tepee warmed by a campfire at a dog musher’s camp.</p>

                        <p>Want northern lights viewing that’s pretty much guaranteed? Head to the new North Pole Igloos Hotel, a pop-up glamping concept in the northernmost 
						place on earth.</p>
                        <p>Travelers stay in heated glass-enclosed igloos with a glass ceiling roof and glass walls that allow guests to view the northern lights from bed.
						It’s not cheap—staying here costs a cool €95,000 (about $105,000), which includes a one-night stay in the North Pole, as well as two nights in nearby 
						Svalbard, plus transportation, meals and guides. Northernmost hotel of the world, North Pole Igloos hotel concept is movable, sustainable, but still
						a little extreme. Depending of weather conditions we move the heated glass igloos to most safe places around the arctic glacier. You can join to the 
						group of very rare people who have spent a night at the North Pole’s glacier.</p>
